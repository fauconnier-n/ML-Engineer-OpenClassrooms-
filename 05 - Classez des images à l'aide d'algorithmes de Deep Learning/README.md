# Classification of dog pictures using Deep Learning

The goal of this project is to use Deep Learning and Tranfert Learning to classify images.
 
The dataset is the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
It contains 120 different races of dog (predicted label), but we only use 10 in this notebook.
 
The **selected model is Xception pretrained (Transfert Learning) on imagenet, and offers an Accuracy of ~84%.**
