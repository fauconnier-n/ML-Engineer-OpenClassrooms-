# Customer segmentation

 The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
 It contains data on sellers and customers and production of Olist Store.
 
 The goal of this project is to use Unsupervised Machine Learning to segment the customers in clusters usable/interpretable by a CRM team. The selected model is trained on features of a standard "RFM" segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value of a customer and its orders) and the average review score left by the customer.
